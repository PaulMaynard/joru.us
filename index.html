            <p>“Machines and societal constructs do not define a culture’s
            maturity, Jedi Skywalker. Maturity is defined solely by the
            understanding and use of the Force.
            
            <p>“There was such a society once, Luke. A vast and shining example
            of the heights all could aspire to. For a thousand generations we
            stood tall among the lesser beings of the galaxy, guardians of
            justice and order. The creators of true civilization. The Senate
            could debate and pass laws; but it was the Jedi who turned those
            laws into reality.</p>
            
            <p>“And in return, the galaxy destroyed us.</p>
            
            <p>“Do you truly believe that even the Emperor could have succeeded
            in such a task without the consent of the entire galaxy? No, Luke.
            They hated us—all the lesser beings did. Hated us for our power, and
            our knowledge, and our wisdom. Hated us for our maturity. And that
            hatred still exists. Waiting only for the Jedi to reemerge to blaze
            up again.”</p>
